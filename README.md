# Flutter Learning Journey

This repository documents my progress as I learn Flutter from scratch. It includes a variety of projects and exercises to explore Flutter's capabilities in building mobile apps.

## ðŸš€ Why Flutter?

Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. I chose to learn Flutter because it enables the development of beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

## ðŸ“‚ Whatâ€™s Inside?

This repository will showcase my progress as I tackle different aspects of Flutter development:

- **Beginner Projects**: Basic applications to get familiar with Flutter.
- **UI Components**: Learning about widgets and how to create user-friendly interfaces.
- **State Management**: Understanding how to handle application state effectively.

## ðŸ“ˆ Progress

I will continue to update this repository with new projects, improvements, and lessons learned as I progress in my Flutter learning journey.
