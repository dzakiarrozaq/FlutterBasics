Flutter Learning Journey
This repository is a collection of projects and exercises as I learn Flutter from the ground up. It includes various examples and experiments as I explore the Flutter framework and build mobile apps.

Why Flutter?
Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. I chose Flutter because it allows building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

What Youâ€™ll Find Here
This repository will document my progress, from the basics to more advanced topics:

Beginner Projects: Simple applications to understand the basics of Flutter.
UI Components: Exploring different widgets and how to create beautiful interfaces.

Progress
As I make progress, I will update this repository with new projects and improvements.
